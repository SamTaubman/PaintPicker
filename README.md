# PaintPicker
PaintPicker is a website that allows users to upload an image then select a color and get the hex code, color name, and paint buying options for the color. Built with React.js, HTML, CSS, The EyeDropper API, and The Color API. 

Type "npm run build" and then "npm start" to run the website on your local machine.

# Use Case
Shown below is the PaintPicker website with the options to upload an image, use the eyedropper tool to select pixels on the image so the hexcode and color name are displayed, and then a button that links to paint buying options for that color.
